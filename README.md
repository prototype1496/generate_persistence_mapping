# Generate Persistence Mapping (Entities) by Database Schema
Ah, the infamous stereotype about developers being lazy! Let’s dispel that myth and dive into the intriguing world of efficiency in software development. You see, it’s not about laziness; it’s about finding the simplest and most efficient ways to get things done. In our fast-paced world, time is of the essence, and completing tasks quickly and accurately is paramount.

So, picture this: you’re knee-deep in software development, and one of the most time-consuming tasks is dealing with boilerplate code. I mean, who enjoys duplicating entire database tables just to convert them into entities? Certainly not me! And assuming you’re using a nifty object-relational mapper like Hibernate (ORM), there has to be a smarter way, right?

Well, fear not, my fellow developers, for I embarked on a quest to conquer this tedious aspect of software development. Why wait for my compiler to finish its coffee break on my Windows machine when I can have the task completed even before it realizes I’m watching? Talk about beating the system!

Now, let me share a method that’ll have you generating those Entity classes from your database faster than you can say “compile.” It’s like a magic trick but for code! I decided to pen down this article because, let’s face it, most of the available resources on this topic are as outdated as my childhood Pokémon cards. IDEs have evolved, and it’s high time our methods did too.
